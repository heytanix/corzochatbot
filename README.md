## Files Overview

### `Chatbot.py`
This is the main Python script for the Corzo Chatbot. (You can change the name of the bot as desired.) This script handles the core functionality of the chatbot, including user interactions, response generation, and data management.

### `knowledge_base.json`
This file serves as the knowledge base for the bot. It is crucial as it stores existing responses that the bot can fetch during conversations. Additionally, any new responses provided by the user are saved in this file, allowing the bot to learn and adapt over time.
